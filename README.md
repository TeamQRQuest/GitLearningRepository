Learn Git from Shardul Kulkarni

You are going to learn about how exactly the git works.

Git is basically a structure that is either a terminal or a GUI which is used to manipulate directory structure of your project using the command line. You can use git to see how your project looked in certain timesteps by commiting every change. You can also go back to last commit if you don't want new change to be incorporated into your project, this is called as Version Control.
